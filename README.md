# The Simpsons Quotes API

This was my first project using React, specifically using class based components. The project was to get used to using and manipulating API data and using basic state to store a like count.

## What I used

- React ([Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for API calls
- CSS for styling
- [Simpsons Quote API](https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/) for the project data
